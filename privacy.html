      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Last updated: November 5, 2025</p>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how StockGenie ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner.</p>

      <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We collect a minimal amount of information to provide and improve our Service. The information we collect includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous data about how you interact with the Service, such as the features you use and the time you spend in the app. This helps us understand user behavior and improve the user experience. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect non-personally identifiable information about your device, such as the model, operating system version, and a unique device identifier for analytics and crash reporting purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Purchase Information:</strong> If you subscribe to our premium features, the transaction is processed through the Apple App Store. We receive anonymous, aggregated data from the App Store for financial reporting and to verify purchases, but we do not collect or store your payment information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
      <p>We are committed to your privacy and do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your name, email address, or phone number.</li>
        <li>Your location data.</li>
        <li>Your financial information or brokerage account details.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Third-Party Data Sources</h3>
      <p>The Service relies on third-party data providers (e.g., Finnhub, Polygon.io) to source stock market data. We do not share any of your personal information with these providers. Your use of our Service is also subject to the terms and privacy policies of these third parties.</p>

      <h3>5. Data Storage</h3>
      <p>Your watchlist, settings, and other preferences are stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to our servers and remains under your control.</p>

      <h3>6. Security</h3>
      <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

      <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

      <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
